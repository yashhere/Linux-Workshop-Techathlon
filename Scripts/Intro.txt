I am writing a history of the things men do. I have written three such histories
and I am but a young man. Already I have written three hundred, four hundred thousand words.
My wife is somewhere in this house where for hours now I have been sitting and writing.
She is a tall woman with black hair, turning a little grey. Listen, she is going
softly up a flight of stairs. All day she goes softly about, doing the housework in our house.
I came here to this town from another town in the state of Iowa. My father was a
workman, a house painter. He did not rise in the world as I have done. I worked
my way through college and became an historian. We own this house in which I sit.
This is my room in which I work. Already I have written three histories of peoples.
I have told how states were formed and battles fought. You may see my books standing
straight up on the shelves of libraries. They stand up like sentries. I am tall like
my wife and my shoulders are a little stooped. Although I write boldly I am a shy man.
I like being at work alone in this room with the door closed. There are many books here.
Nations march back and forth in the books. It is quiet here but in the books a great
thundering goes on.

My wife has a serious, almost stern look. Sometimes the thoughts I have concerning
her frighten me. In the afternoon she leaves our house and goes for a walk. Sometimes
she goes to stores, sometimes to visit a neighbor. There is a yellow house opposite
our house. My wife goes out at a side door and passes along the street between our
house and the yellow house. The side door of our house bangs. There is a moment of
waiting. My wife's face floats across the yellow background of a picture.

Little things are growing big in my mind. The window before my desk makes a little
framed place like a picture. Every day I sit staring. I wait with an odd sensation
of something impending. My hand trembles. The face that floats through the picture
does something I don't understand. The face floats, then it stops. It goes from the
right hand side to the left hand side, then it stops. The face comes into my mind
and goes out--the face floats in my mind. The pen has fallen from my fingers. The
house is silent. The eyes of the floating face are turned away from me. My wife is a
girl who came here to this town from another town in the state of Ohio. We keep a
servant but my wife often sweeps the floors and she sometimes makes the bed in
which we sleep together. We sit together in the evening but I do not know her.
I cannot shake myself out of myself. I wear a brown coat and I cannot come out of
my coat. I cannot come out of myself. My wife is very gentle and she speaks softly
but she cannot come out of herself. My wife has gone out of the house. She does
not know that I know every little thought of her life. I know what she thought when
she was a child and walked in the streets of an Ohio town. I have heard the voices of
her mind. I have heard the little voices. I heard the voice of fear crying when she
was first overtaken with passion and crawled into my arms. Again I heard the voices
of fear when her lips said words of courage to me as we sat together on the first
evening after we were married and moved into this house. It would be strange if I
could sit here, as I am doing now, while my own face floated across the picture
made by the yellow house and the window. It would be strange and beautiful if I
could meet my wife, come into her presence. The woman whose face floated across
my picture just now knows nothing of me. I know nothing of her. She has gone off,
along a street. The voices of her mind are talking. I am here in this room, as
alone as ever any man God made. It would be strange and beautiful if I could float
my face across my picture. If my floating face could come into her presence, if
it could come into the presence of any man or any woman--that would be a strange
and beautiful thing to have happen.
